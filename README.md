# dnd-encounters-2021

This project is a truncated version of the tabletop game D&D, based on the 5th edition. It's perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to play the game or wants a more casual D&D experience. There are so many rules and options in the traditional tabletop version and can often be difficult to find a party
and someone willing to DM. This game removes any apprehension one might feel from starting a game
before being familiar with the rules and conventions. 

I built this project using Nodejs, Express and React. I also included Google login authentication.
